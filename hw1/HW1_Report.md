## Program structure

### Main script

`main.py` stand for the "main sricpt", which import the other 3 modules to perform different type of algorithm based on various inputs.

### Searching subroutine

All of the subroutines have build-in profiling functionality.

+ `bfs.py` - Breadth First Search
+ `ids.py` - Iteractive Deeping Search
+ `astar.py` - A* search, (with heuristic function)

### Basic DataStructre & functions

Common data structures for tree searching, which is specilly designed for this problem, are defined in `computeTree.py`.

In `util.py`,common functions were defined based on the data structure in `compteTree.py`, such as showing the solution using backtracking from the leaf node.

## Profiling outcomes
